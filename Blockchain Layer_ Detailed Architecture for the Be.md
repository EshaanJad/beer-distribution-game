 
Blockchain Layer: Detailed Architecture for the Beer Distribution Game
The blockchain layer is the backbone of the transparent supply chain in the Beer Distribution Game. It ensures immutability, transparency, and trust among players. Below is a detailed breakdown of its architecture and components:
 
Smart Contract Design
1. Core Smart Contract
The smart contract will manage the game logic and record all critical transactions on-chain. It will include:
•	Game Initialization:
o	Parameters: gameId, playerRoles, inventoryLevels, orderDelays, shippingDelays.
o	Functions:
	createGame(gameId, configParams): Initializes a new game with specified parameters.
	joinGame(gameId, role): Allows players to join a specific game session and assigns roles.
•	Order Management:
o	Functions:
	placeOrder(gameId, senderRole, recipientRole, quantity): Records an order placed by a player.
	shipOrder(gameId, orderId): Marks an order as shipped.
	receiveOrder(gameId, orderId): Marks an order as received and updates inventory.
•	Inventory Management:
o	Functions:
	updateInventory(gameId, playerRole, newInventory): Updates inventory levels for a player.
•	Game State Management:
o	Functions:
	advanceWeek(gameId): Advances the game to the next week and triggers cost calculations.
2. Data Structures
The smart contract will use Solidity mappings and structs to store data efficiently:
•	Player Struct:
struct Player {
    address playerAddress;
    uint256 inventory;
    uint256 backlog;
    uint256 incomingOrders;
    uint256 outgoingOrders;
}

•	Order Struct:
struct Order {
    uint256 orderId;
    address sender;
    address recipient;
    uint256 quantity;
    string status; // "Pending", "Shipped", "Delivered"
}

•	Mappings:
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => Player)) public games; // Game ID to Players
mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public orders; // Game ID to Orders

3. Events
To enable real-time updates on the frontend, the contract will emit events for critical actions:
•	event OrderPlaced(uint256 gameId, uint256 orderId, address sender, address recipient, uint256 quantity);
•	event OrderShipped(uint256 gameId, uint256 orderId);
•	event OrderDelivered(uint256 gameId, uint256 orderId);
•	event InventoryUpdated(uint256 gameId, address player, uint256 newInventory);
•	event WeekAdvanced(uint256 gameId);
 
Blockchain Network
1. Platform
•	Ethereum or a Layer-2 solution (e.g., Polygon or Arbitrum) for lower transaction costs and faster processing.
2. Gas Optimization
To minimize gas costs:
•	Use compact data structures (e.g., mappings instead of arrays where possible).
•	Batch process repetitive actions (e.g., advancing weeks or updating multiple inventories).
3. Consensus Mechanism
The blockchain network will use Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which is more energy-efficient and faster than Proof-of-Work (PoW).
 
Blockchain Features in the Game
1. Immutable Record of Transactions
Every order placed, shipped, or delivered is recorded on-chain. This ensures that all actions are transparent and verifiable by any player.
2. Real-Time Verification
Players can verify the authenticity of orders and inventory updates using blockchain explorers or in-game verification badges.
3. Trustless Interactions
No central authority is required to validate actions. The smart contract enforces rules and ensures fairness.
 
Integration with Other Layers
Backend Server
The backend server interacts with the blockchain via Web3.js or Ethers.js to:
1.	Submit transactions (e.g., placing orders).
2.	Listen for events emitted by the smart contract.
3.	Sync on-chain data with the database for analytics.
Frontend
The frontend uses Web3.js to:
1.	Allow players to connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
2.	Display verified data from the blockchain (e.g., inventory levels).
3.	Notify players of transaction statuses in real-time.
