 
Detailed System Design for Blockchain-Enabled Beer Distribution Game
Blockchain Layer
Smart Contract Architecture
•	GameFactory Contract: Creates and manages individual game instances
o	Handles game creation with configurable parameters (delays, demand patterns)
o	Maintains registry of active games and their participants
o	Controls game lifecycle (setup, active, completed)
•	GameInstance Contract: Represents a single game session
o	Stores current game state (week number, player inventories, orders)
o	Implements core game logic (order processing, inventory updates)
o	Enforces rules and validates player actions
o	Emits events for all state changes
•	PlayerRegistry Contract: Manages player identities and roles
o	Associates wallet addresses with player profiles
o	Handles role assignments within games
o	Tracks player performance metrics
On-Chain Data Structures
•	Player data (role, inventory, backlog, costs)
•	Order records (sender, recipient, quantity, status)
•	Supply chain events (shipments, deliveries, inventory changes)
•	Game configuration parameters
Blockchain Events
•	OrderPlaced(gameId, orderId, sender, recipient, quantity, timestamp)
•	OrderShipped(gameId, orderId, timestamp)
•	OrderDelivered(gameId, orderId, timestamp)
•	InventoryUpdated(gameId, player, newInventory, timestamp)
•	WeekAdvanced(gameId, newWeekNumber)
Backend Server
Core Components
•	Game Coordinator: Orchestrates game flow and synchronizes player actions
o	Manages turn-based gameplay
o	Handles customer demand generation
o	Processes end-of-week calculations
•	Blockchain Service: Interfaces with Ethereum network
o	Manages contract interactions via Web3.js
o	Handles transaction signing and submission
o	Listens for contract events
o	Implements retry and error handling for failed transactions
•	Authentication Service: Manages player identity
o	Supports both traditional login and wallet-based authentication
o	Issues JWT tokens for API authorization
o	Handles session management
•	WebSocket Server: Enables real-time updates
o	Pushes game state changes to connected clients
o	Notifies players of other players' actions
o	Broadcasts blockchain transaction confirmations
API Endpoints
•	/api/games - Game management (create, join, list)
•	/api/players - Player profile management
•	/api/orders - Order placement and tracking
•	/api/inventory - Inventory management
•	/api/analytics - Game performance metrics
Database (MongoDB)
Collections
•	Users: Player profiles, credentials, and preferences
o	Username, email, password hash
o	Wallet address (if using blockchain authentication)
o	Game history and performance statistics
•	Games: Game session metadata
o	Configuration parameters
o	Start/end timestamps
o	Player roster
o	Current game state
o	Smart contract address for the game instance
•	GameHistory: Historical game data
o	Complete record of all game actions
o	Performance metrics for each player
o	Supply chain efficiency measurements
o	Bullwhip effect analysis data
•	Analytics: Aggregated game statistics
o	Average costs by role
o	Order variability metrics
o	Blockchain impact measurements
Indexing Strategy
•	Compound indexes on game sessions and player IDs
•	Time-series indexes for historical analysis
•	Text indexes for searching game metadata
Frontend Architecture
Component Structure
•	Game Dashboard: Main player interface
o	Role-specific view with inventory and order controls
o	Supply chain visualization showing all roles
o	Real-time updates of game state
•	Blockchain Integration Components:
o	Wallet connector for authentication
o	Transaction confirmation modals
o	Blockchain explorer integration
o	Verification badges for confirmed transactions
•	Analytics Dashboard: Data visualization
o	Real-time charts of inventory levels and orders
o	Blockchain verification status indicators
o	Historical performance metrics
o	Bullwhip effect visualization
State Management
•	Redux store for game state
o	Player inventory and orders
o	Game configuration
o	Transaction status
•	React Context for blockchain connection
o	Wallet connection status
o	Network information
o	Transaction history
Real-time Updates
•	WebSocket connection for game state changes
•	Blockchain event listeners for transaction confirmations
•	Optimistic UI updates with confirmation indicators
Integration Points
Data Synchronization
•	Backend polls blockchain for state changes every 15 seconds
•	Critical game actions trigger immediate blockchain transactions
•	Non-critical data stored in MongoDB with blockchain references
Event Flow
1.	Player initiates action in UI
2.	Frontend sends request to backend API
3.	Backend validates request and updates database
4.	Backend submits transaction to blockchain
5.	Smart contract processes transaction and emits event
6.	Backend listens for event and updates game state
7.	WebSocket pushes updates to all connected clients
Fallback Mechanisms
•	Offline mode with local storage for temporary disconnections
•	Transaction queue for handling blockchain network congestion
•	Reconciliation process for resolving state inconsistencies
This comprehensive system design provides a robust foundation for implementing the blockchain-enabled Beer Distribution Game, balancing the educational aspects of the traditional game with the transparency benefits of blockchain technology.
