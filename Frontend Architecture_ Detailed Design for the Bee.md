 
Frontend Architecture: Detailed Design for the Beer Distribution Game
The frontend layer serves as the player interface for the Beer Distribution Game, providing an intuitive, responsive experience while integrating with blockchain features. This layer must effectively visualize supply chain dynamics and facilitate player decision-making.
Core Components
1. Application Structure
•	React.js Framework: Provides component-based architecture for modular development and efficient rendering.
•	State Management: Redux for global state management, particularly for game state and blockchain interactions.
•	Routing: React Router for navigation between game setup, gameplay, and analytics views.
2. Key Components Hierarchy
•	App Container: Root component managing authentication and global navigation.
o	Game Setup: Configuration interface for creating/joining games.
o	Game Dashboard: Main gameplay interface with role-specific views.
o	Analytics Dashboard: Data visualization and performance metrics.
o	Blockchain Integration: Components for wallet connection and transaction verification.
3. Real-Time Communication
•	WebSocket Integration: Using Socket.io client to establish persistent connections with the backend.
•	Event Handlers: Listeners for game state updates, player actions, and blockchain confirmations.
•	Optimistic UI Updates: Immediate UI feedback with pending states until server/blockchain confirmation.
Game Dashboard Design
1. Role-Specific Views
•	Dynamic interface adapting to player role (Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor, Factory).
•	Color-coded elements matching role colors from the AnyLogic implementation.
2. Supply Chain Visualization
•	Interactive diagram showing the entire supply chain.
•	Visual indicators for inventory levels, orders, and shipments.
•	Blockchain verification badges for confirmed transactions.
3. Order Management Interface
•	Input controls for placing orders.
•	Historical view of previous orders and their statuses.
•	Transaction confirmation modals for blockchain-enabled games.
Blockchain Integration
1. Wallet Connection
•	Integration with Web3.js/Ethers.js for connecting to MetaMask or other wallets.
•	Account status display showing connected address and network.
2. Transaction Management
•	Transaction submission interface with gas estimation.
•	Pending transaction indicators and confirmation notifications.
•	Transaction history view with links to blockchain explorers.
3. Verification Components
•	Badges indicating blockchain-verified data.
•	Tooltips explaining the verification process.
•	Visual differentiation between verified and unverified information.
Data Visualization
1. Real-Time Charts
•	Inventory level trends across the supply chain.
•	Order variability visualization demonstrating the bullwhip effect.
•	Cost comparison between different roles.
2. Performance Metrics
•	Role-specific KPIs (inventory efficiency, backlog costs).
•	Supply chain efficiency indicators.
•	Blockchain impact measurements (when enabled).
Responsive Design
•	Adaptive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
•	Touch-friendly controls for mobile gameplay.
•	Optimized rendering for performance across devices.
Technical Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
•	React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations.
•	Virtualized lists for rendering large datasets.
•	Code splitting to reduce initial load time.
2. Accessibility
•	ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.
•	Keyboard navigation support.
•	Color contrast compliance with WCAG standards.
3. Error Handling
•	Graceful degradation for network failures.
•	Informative error messages for blockchain transaction failures.
•	Automatic reconnection attempts for WebSocket disconnections.
The frontend architecture is designed to provide an engaging, educational experience while seamlessly integrating blockchain features when enabled. The interface will adapt based on the host's configuration, ensuring that the game can be played with or without blockchain technology while maintaining its core educational value about supply chain dynamics.
