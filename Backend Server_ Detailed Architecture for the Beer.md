 
Backend Server: Detailed Architecture for the Beer Distribution Game
The backend server acts as the central coordinator for game sessions, player management, and blockchain interactions. It ensures smooth gameplay while integrating blockchain features seamlessly.
 
Core Components
1. Game Coordinator
•	Responsibilities:
o	Orchestrates game flow (turn-based mechanics, advancing weeks).
o	Manages customer demand generation based on game configuration.
o	Processes end-of-week calculations (inventory updates, backlog costs).
•	Key Functions:
o	createGame(configParams): Initializes a new game session.
o	joinGame(gameId, playerInfo): Adds players to a specific game instance.
o	processOrder(gameId, senderRole, recipientRole, quantity): Validates and processes orders.
o	advanceWeek(gameId): Updates game state and triggers blockchain transactions.
2. Blockchain Service
•	Responsibilities:
o	Interfaces with Ethereum or Layer-2 networks via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
o	Submits transactions to the smart contract (e.g., order placement, inventory updates).
o	Listens for contract events (e.g., OrderPlaced, InventoryUpdated) and updates the database accordingly.
•	Key Functions:
o	submitTransaction(functionName, params): Sends transactions to the smart contract.
o	listenForEvents(eventName): Monitors blockchain events and triggers corresponding actions in the backend.
3. Authentication Service
•	Responsibilities:
o	Manages player authentication (traditional login or wallet-based).
o	Issues JWT tokens for API authorization.
o	Handles session management and role assignments.
•	Key Functions:
o	authenticatePlayer(credentials): Validates login credentials or wallet connection.
o	generateToken(playerId): Issues JWT tokens for secure API access.
4. WebSocket Server
•	Responsibilities:
o	Enables real-time communication between players and the server.
o	Pushes game state updates to all connected clients.
o	Notifies players of blockchain transaction confirmations and other events.
•	Key Functions:
o	broadcastUpdate(gameId, updateData): Sends updates to all players in a game session.
o	notifyPlayer(playerId, notificationData): Sends individual notifications.
 
API Endpoints
Game Management
•	/api/games/create:
o	Input: Configuration parameters (delays, demand patterns).
o	Output: Game ID and initial state.
•	/api/games/join:
o	Input: Game ID and player info (role, wallet address).
o	Output: Confirmation of successful join.
Player Management
•	/api/players/authenticate:
o	Input: Credentials or wallet address.
o	Output: JWT token for API access.
Order Management
•	/api/orders/place:
o	Input: Game ID, sender role, recipient role, quantity.
o	Output: Transaction hash if blockchain-enabled.
Inventory Management
•	/api/inventory/update:
o	Input: Game ID, player role, new inventory level.
o	Output: Confirmation of update.
Analytics
•	/api/analytics/gameHistory:
o	Input: Game ID.
o	Output: Historical data of all actions in the game.
 
Database Synchronization
The backend server syncs data between the database and blockchain layer to provide a seamless experience:
1.	Game State Updates:
o	When a transaction is submitted to the blockchain (e.g., order placement), the server updates the database with pending status until confirmation is received.
2.	Event Handling:
o	Blockchain events trigger updates in the database (e.g., marking orders as shipped/delivered).
3.	Historical Data Storage:
o	Non-critical data (e.g., analytics metrics) is stored in MongoDB for efficient querying and analysis.
 
Error Handling
1.	Blockchain Transaction Failures:
o	Implement retry mechanisms for failed transactions due to network congestion or gas price issues.
o	Notify players of failed actions via WebSocket.
2.	State Inconsistencies:
o	Periodic reconciliation between database state and blockchain state ensures consistency.
3.	Player Disconnections:
o	Offline mode allows temporary local storage of actions until reconnection.
 
Integration Points
Interaction with Blockchain Layer
•	Submits transactions to smart contracts using Web3.js/Ethers.js.
•	Listens for blockchain events and updates game state accordingly.
Interaction with Frontend
•	Provides RESTful APIs for frontend communication (game creation, order placement).
•	Pushes real-time updates via WebSocket connections.
